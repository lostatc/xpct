//! xpct is an assertions library for Rust.
//!
//! It's designed to be ergonomic, batteries-included, and test framework agnostic.
//!
//! # Tutorial
//!
//! To make an assertion, you'll usually start with the [`expect`] macro:
//!
//! ```
//! use xpct::{expect, equal};
//!
//! expect!("Disco").to(equal("Disco"));
//! ```
//!
//! In the above example, [`equal`] is a *matcher*. This crate provides a number of matchers in the
//! crate root, and you can implement custom matchers as well.
//!
//! When an assertion fails, it panics with an error message.
//!
//! You can also chain matchers like this:
//!
//! ```
//! use xpct::{expect, be_gt, be_lt};
//!
//! expect!(41)
//!     .to(be_gt(0)) // 41 > 0
//!     .to(be_lt(57)); // 41 < 57
//! ```
//!
//! When you chain together multiple matchers like this, the assertion only succeeds if *all* of
//! them match.
//!
//! You can also negate matchers by calling `to_not` or using the [`not`] matcher:
//!
//! ```
//! use xpct::{expect, equal, not};
//!
//! expect!(41).to_not(equal(57));
//!
//! expect!(41).to(not(equal(57)));
//! ```
//!
//! Not all matchers can be negated like this; matchers that can be negated will return a
//! [`Matcher`], while matchers that cannot be negated will return a [`PosMatcher`]. You'll see the
//! terms "pos" and "neg," short for *positive* and *negative*, throughout the API a lot. These
//! refer to whether a matcher is negated (negative) or not negated (positive).
//!
//! When you chain together matchers, they pass the value you passed to [`expect`] into the next
//! matcher in the chain. Matchers can change the type of this value, which allows some matchers to
//! perform type narrowing.
//!
//! ```
//! use xpct::{expect, equal, be_ok};
//!
//! fn might_fail() -> anyhow::Result<String> {
//!     Ok(String::from("Whirling-in-Rags"))
//! }
//!
//! expect!(might_fail())
//!     .to(be_ok())
//!     .to(equal("Whirling-in-Rags"));
//! ```
//!
//! In the above example, we don't need to unwrap the [`Result`], because the [`be_ok`] matcher did
//! it for us! If we were to negate this matcher with [`not`], then it would return the value of
//! the [`Err`] variant instead.
//!
//! You can always get the value back out at the end by calling [`Assertion::into_inner`].
//!
//! ```
//! use xpct::{expect, be_some};
//!
//! let name: &'static str = expect!(Some("RaphaÃ«l Ambrosius Costeau"))
//!     .to(be_some())
//!     .into_inner();
//! ```
//!
//! There are combinator matchers like [`all`], [`each`], and [`any`] which allow us to combine
//! matchers in different ways:
//!
//! ```
//! use xpct::{expect, each, any, equal, be_some};
//!
//! fn necktie_kind() -> Option<String> {
//!     Some(String::from("horrific"))
//! }
//!
//! expect!(necktie_kind()).to(each(|ctx| {
//!     ctx.by_ref()
//!         .to(be_some())
//!         .to(equal(&Some(String::from("horrific"))));
//! }));
//!
//! ```
//!

//! [`PosMatcher`]: crate::core::PosMatcher
//! [`Assertion::into_inner`]: crate::core::Assertion::into_inner
