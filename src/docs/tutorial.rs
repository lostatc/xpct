A high-level tutorial on how to make assertions with xpct.

To make an assertion, you'll usually start with the [`expect!`] macro:

```
use xpct::{expect, equal};

expect!("disco").to(equal("disco"));
```

In the above example, [`equal`] is a *matcher*. This crate provides a number of
matchers in the crate root, and you can implement custom matchers as well.

When an assertion fails, it panics with an error message.

You can also chain matchers like this:

```
use xpct::{expect, be_gt, be_lt};

expect!(41)
    .to(be_gt(0)) // 41 > 0
    .to(be_lt(57)); // 41 < 57
```

When you chain together multiple matchers like this, the assertion only succeeds
if *all* of them match.

You can also negate matchers by calling [`Assertion::to_not`] or using the
[`not`] matcher:

```
use xpct::{expect, equal, not};

// These are equivalent.
expect!(41).to_not(equal(57));
expect!(41).to(not(equal(57)));
```

When you chain together matchers, they pass the value you passed to [`expect!`]
into the next matcher in the chain. Matchers can change the type of this value,
which allows some matchers to do things like unwrap [`Result`] and [`Option`]
types.

```
use xpct::{expect, equal, be_ok};

fn location() -> anyhow::Result<String> {
    Ok(String::from("Whirling-in-Rags"))
}

expect!(location())
    .to(be_ok())
    .to(equal("Whirling-in-Rags"));
```

In the above example, we don't need to unwrap the [`Result`], because the
[`be_ok`] matcher did it for us! If we were to negate this matcher with [`not`],
then it would return the value of the [`Err`] variant instead.

If you want to map a value from one type to another as part of a chain of
matchers, but don't need a dedicated matcher for it, you can use the matchers
[`map`] and [`try_map`] as well as [`Assertion::map`] and
[`Assertion::try_map`].

```
use std::convert::Infallible;

use xpct::{expect, map, try_map, equal};

struct Name(String);

expect!(Name(String::from("Cuno")))
    .map(|name| name.0)
    .to(equal("Cuno"));

let name: Result<_, Infallible> = Ok(String::from("Cuno"));

expect!(name)
    .to(map(Result::unwrap))
    .to(equal("Cuno"));

// We use `try_map` for conversions that can fail.
expect!(vec![0x43, 0x75, 0x6e, 0x6f])
    .try_map(|bytes| Ok(String::from_utf8(bytes)?))
    .to(equal("Cuno"));
```

If you need to convert between types that implement [`From`] or [`TryFrom`], you
can use [`Assertion::into`] and [`Assertion::try_into`].

```
use xpct::{expect, equal};

expect!(41u64)
    .try_into::<u32>()
    .to(equal(41u32));
```

You can always get the value back out at the end of a chain of matchers by
calling [`Assertion::into_inner`].

```
use xpct::{expect, be_some};

let name: &'static str = expect!(Some("RaphaÃ«l Ambrosius Costeau"))
    .to(be_some())
    .into_inner();
```

There are combinator matchers like [`all`], [`each`], and [`any`] which allow us
to combine matchers in different ways:

```
use xpct::{expect, any, equal, be_none};

fn description() -> Option<String> {
    None
}

// This is either `None` or `Some("horrific")`.
expect!(description()).to(any(|ctx| {
    ctx.map(Option::as_deref)
        .to(be_none())
        .to(equal(Some("horrific")));
}));

```

If you want to attach additional context to a matcher to include in the failure
output, you can use [`why`] and [`why_lazy`]:

```
use xpct::{expect, why, not, equal};

expect!("Kim Kitsuragi").to(why(
    not(equal("kim kitsuragi")),
    "names should be capitalized"
));
```

If you want to match on multiple fields of a struct, rather than using a
separate [`expect!`] assertion for each field, you can use [`match_fields`] with
the [`fields!`] macro.

```
use xpct::{expect, match_fields, fields, equal, be_none, be_ge, be_true};

struct Person {
    name: Option<String>,
    id: String,
    age: u32,
    is_superstar: bool,
}

let value = Person {
    name: None,
    id: String::from("LTN-2JFR"),
    age: 44,
    is_superstar: true,
};

expect!(value).to(match_fields(fields!(Person {
    name: be_none(),
    id: equal("LTN-2JFR"),
    age: be_ge(44),
    is_superstar: be_true(),
})));
```
