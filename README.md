# xpct

xpct is an extensible test assertion library for Rust. It's designed to be
ergonomic, batteries-included, and test framework agnostic.

Want to get started? [Check out the
tutorial](https://docs.rs/xpct/latest/xpct/docs/tutorial/index.html).

## About

xpct is extensible. In addition to allowing you to write custom matchers, it
separates the logic of matchers from how they format their output, meaning you
can:

1. Hook into existing formatters to write custom matchers with pretty output
   without having to worry about formatting.
2. Customize the formatting of existing matchers without having to reimplement
   their logic.

This crate also aims to provide many useful matchers out of the box. Check out
the full [list of provided
matchers](https://docs.rs/xpct/latest/xpct/docs/matcher_list/index.html).

## Examples

A simple equality assertion, like `assert_eq`:

```rust,should_panic
use xpct::{expect, equal};

expect!("disco").to(equal("Disco"));
```

```text
[src/main.rs:4:5] = "disco"
    Expected:
        "disco"
    to equal:
        "Disco"
```

Unwrapping a `Some` value to make an assertion on the wrapped value:

```rust,should_panic
use xpct::{be_gt, be_some, expect};

expect!(Some(41))
    .to(be_some())
    .to(be_gt(57));
```

```text
[src/main.rs:6:5] = Some(41)
    Expected:
        41
    to be greater than:
        57
```

Making assertions about individual fields of a struct:

```rust,should_panic
use xpct::{be_empty, be_in, be_true, expect, fields, have_prefix, match_fields, not, why};

struct Player {
    id: String,
    name: String,
    level: u32,
    is_superstar: bool,
}

let player = Player {
    id: String::from("REV12-62-05-JAM41"),
    name: String::from(""),
    level: 21,
    is_superstar: false,
};

expect!(player).to(match_fields(fields!(Player {
    id: have_prefix("REV"),
    name: not(be_empty()),
    level: be_in(1..=20),
    is_superstar: why(be_true(), "only superstars allowed"),
})));
```

```text
[src/main.rs:18:5] = player
    Expected all of these fields to succeed:
        my_crate::main::Player {
            id: OK
            name: FAILED
                Expected:
                    ""
                to not be empty
            level: FAILED
                Expected:
                    21
                to be in:
                    1..=20
            is_superstar: FAILED
                ðŸ›ˆ only superstars allowed
                Expected this to be true
        }
```

Asserting that every element of a collection is `Some(_)` and is not an empty
string:

```rust,should_panic
use xpct::{all, be_empty, be_some, every, expect, not};

let names = [Some(""), Some("Cuno"), None];

expect!(names).to(every(|| all(|ctx| {
    ctx.to(be_some())?.to(not(be_empty()))
})));
```

```text
[src/main.rs:6:5] = names
    Expected all of these to succeed:
        [0]  FAILED
             Expected:
                 ""
             to not be empty

        [2]  FAILED
             Expected:
                 None
             to be Some(_)
```

## MSRV Policy

The last two stable Rust releases are supported. Older releases may be supported
as well.

The MSRV will only be increased when necessary to take advantage of new Rust
featuresâ€”not every time there is a new Rust release. An increase in the MSRV
will be accompanied by a minor semver bump if >=1.0.0 or a patch semver bump if
<1.0.0.

## Semver Policy

Prior to version 1.0.0, breaking changes will be accompanied by a minor version
bump, and new features and bug fixes will be accompanied by a patch version
bump.
