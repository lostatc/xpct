# xpct

xpct is an assertions library for Rust. It's designed to be ergonomic,
batteries-included, and test framework agnostic.

## About

xpct is extensible. In addition to allowing you to write custom matchers, it
separates the logic of matchers from how they format their output, meaning you
can:

1. Hook into existing formatters to write custom matchers with pretty output
   without having to worry about formatting.
2. Customize the formatting of existing matchers without having to reimplement
   their logic.

tutorial](https://docs.rs/xpct/latest/xpct/docs/tutorial/index.html).

*How do you pronounce "xpct"?*

However you choose to pronounce it is how it's pronounced! I pronounce it like
"expect."

## Examples

A simple equality assertion, like `assert_eq`:

```rust,should_panic
use xpct::{expect, equal};

expect!("disco").to(equal("Disco"));
```

```text
[src/main.rs:4:5] = "disco"
    Expected:
        "disco"
    to equal:
        "Disco"
```

Asserting that every element in a vec is `Some` and unwrapping it to a
`Vec<&str>`:

```rust,should_panic
use xpct::{be_some, every, expect};

let items = vec![Some("foo"), Some("bar"), None];

let output: Vec<&str> = expect!(items)
    .to(every(be_some))
    .into_inner();
```

```text
[src/main.rs:6:29] = items
    Expected all of these to be OK:
        [0]  OK
        
        [1]  OK
        
        [2]  FAILED
             Expected this to be Some(_)
```

Asserting that the given string does not match any of the given matchers:

```rust,should_panic
use xpct::{any, contain_substr, equal, expect, match_regex};

let location = String::from("Central Jamrock");

expect!(location).to_not(any(|ctx| {
    ctx.borrow::<str>()
        .to(match_regex("^(The )?Pox$"))
        .to(contain_substr("Jamrock"))
        .to(equal("Martinaise"));
}));
```

```text
[src/main.rs:6:5] = location
    Expected all of these to be OK:
        [0]  OK
        
        [1]  FAILED
             Expected:
                 "Central Jamrock"
             to not contain the substring:
                 "Jamrock"

        [2]  OK
```

Making assertions about individual fields of a struct:

```rust,should_panic
use xpct::{
    all, be_empty, be_gt, be_ok, be_some, be_true, expect, fields, have_prefix, match_fields,
    why,
};

struct Person {
    name: Option<String>,
    age: u32,
    id: String,
    is_superstar: bool,
}

fn get_person() -> anyhow::Result<Person> {
    Ok(Person {
        name: None,
        age: 44,
        id: String::from("12-62-05-JAM41"),
        is_superstar: true,
    })
}

expect!(get_person())
    .to(be_ok())
    .to(match_fields(fields!(Person {
        name: all(|ctx| ctx
            .to(be_some())?
            .to_not(be_empty())
        ),
        age: be_gt(0),
        id: why(have_prefix("REV"), "all IDs must have this prefix"),
        is_superstar: be_true(),
    })));
```

```text
[src/main.rs:22:5] = get_person()
    Expected all of these to be OK:
        my_crate::main::Person {
            name: FAILED
                Expected this to be Some(_)
            age: OK
            id: FAILED
                ðŸ›ˆ all IDs must have this prefix
                Expected:
                    "12-62-05-JAM41"
                to have the prefix:
                    "REV"
            is_superstar: OK
        }
```
